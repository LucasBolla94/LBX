      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-[var(--foreground)]/80 mb-6">
        Imagine staking like putting your money into a high-interest savings account. Instead of leaving your tokens idle in your wallet, you can lock them for a period and earn passive rewards â€” just like earning interest at a bank.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-[var(--foreground)]/80 mb-6">
        By staking your <strong>$LBXO</strong>, you help secure the network and contribute to the projectâ€™s stability. In return, you receive regular reward payouts. Itâ€™s a smart way to make your tokens work for you.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-[var(--foreground)]/80 mb-6">
        You can unstake whenever you want (depending on the pool rules), and you keep full control of your funds. Itâ€™s simple, safe, and rewarding â€” perfect even for beginners!
